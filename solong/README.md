This is my Solong project. 
Solong project is about making a little 2d game making use of the MiniLibX, a didactic library based on X libraries.
Given that this library is absolutely NOT system-agnostic, this game (which include the minilibx version used for keeping it theoretically executable in the future, too) is likely to only work under MacOs.

During this project i made some modification to my libft, and i learned about some programming concepts like "hook" and "loop". It gave me the chance to think about the X system and how a pixel information can be stored in memory (char pointers).

To execute:

Make
./pepiro /maps/<which_map>

Some maps are purposedly created with a misconfiguration, as the program must be able to handle these.
