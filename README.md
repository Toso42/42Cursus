# 42Cursus

This is a historical view of my 42 School projects.

In this Git repository, I will gradually upload the projects that I have completed during my experience at 42 School of Rome.

# Why this Git?

I have created this Git repository to give myself an opportunity to reflect on my past and present work from an outside perspective. It also serves as a reference for the future, allowing me to document my thoughts on what I learned during these assignments. Additionally, I aim to provide explanations for the code within these projects, enabling me to reflect on what I have learned and why I made certain choices when "pushing" each project.

# What's 42 School?

42 School is a private and tuition-free programming school that follows a peer-to-peer learning and gamification model. For more information on what 42 School is and how it works, I will provide links at the bottom of this README.
