# 42Cursus
This is an historical view on my 42-School Projects.

In this Repo i will upload, in time, the projects that i have completed during my experience at the 42 School of Rome. 

# Why this Repo?
I create this Git to have an opportunity to look back at my past (and present) work, and to let me share my thoughts on what i learned during these assignments, while also explaining the code within these projects (and thus, reflect myself on what i have indeed learned and why i did what i did at the time of "pushing" the project).

#What's 42 School?
42 School is a private and free programming school, but it is also a tuiton-free model based on p2p learning and gamification. For more information on what the 42 School is and how it works, i'll provide links at the bottom of this readme.
