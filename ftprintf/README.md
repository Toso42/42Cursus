This is my original ft_printf. This project i completed only with the mandatory assignment. By the time i am writing this README i have already
made additions to my original ft_printf. All the new additions can (and will) be found on my libft folder, which is the last version of my library,
containing functions and utilities i created while completing other projects.

As said, this is my original ft_printf, with no bonus, which was a relatively easy and quick to complete project, which i did immediatly after pushing 
my libft project.

# Notes
Even though not much of the base code of the ft_printf has changed till now, in the code there are still leftovers and redundant conditions that i will trim in time. The Makefile shows that by the time i pushed this project, i scarcely understood how it worked. 
Also, the redundant and unnecessary use of protections and the leftover or unnecessary pointers carried through the code show my little understanding of pointers and memory, too.
