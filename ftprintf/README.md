This is my original ft_printf. This project i completed only with the mandatory assignment. By the time i am writing this README i have already
made additions to my original ft_printf. All the new additions can (and will) be found on my libft folder, which is the last version of my library,
containing functions and utilities i created while completing other projects.

As said, this is my original ft_printf, with no bonus, which was a relatively easy and quick to complete project, which i did immediatly after pushing 
my libft project.
